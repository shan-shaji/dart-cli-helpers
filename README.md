# Dart CLI Packages

The repo contains a collection of packages that will assist you in developing CLI applications in Dart. Please feel free to update this list as there may be packages that I am unaware of.



## [very_good_cli](very_good_cli)

Generate a Dart CLI with Very Good CLI. If you are making a CLI package for the first time this is the needed tool for you.
They also have pretty good [documentation](very_good_cli_documentation) about using this template.


## [mason_logger](mason_logger)

This is yet another package from Very Good Ventures. The package is more than just a logger and allows you to accept user inputs and will help you to build lot of other cool things.

Some feature are:

- Show progress to user.
- Allows users to select from different options.
- Prompts to accept user inputs.

## [args](args)
This library lets you define parsers for parsing raw command-line arguments into a set of options and values using GNU and POSIX style options.

note: If you are using [very_good_cli](very_good_cli) then by default this package will be included in the boilerplate.
